                One-Punch Man (Japanese: ワンパンマン, Hepburn: Wanpanman) is a Japanese superhero franchise created by the artist ONE. It tells the story of Saitama, a superhero who can defeat any opponent with a single punch but seeks to find a worthy opponent after growing
                bored by a lack of challenge due to his overwhelming strength. ONE wrote the original webcomic version in early 2009. A digital manga remake began publication on Shueisha's Tonari no Young Jump website in June 2012. The manga is illustrated
                by Yusuke Murata, and its chapters are periodically compiled and published into individual tankōbon volumes. As of December 2021, 24 volumes have been released. In North America, Viz Media has licensed the remake manga for English language
                release and was serialized in its Weekly Shonen Jump digital magazine.
